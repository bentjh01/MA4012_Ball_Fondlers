# Ball Fondlers Meeting Agenda

## Date: Feb 21st, 2024

## Time: 2030-2130 hrs

## Attendees:

- Benjamin Teh

## Agenda:

1. **Review of Status Quo**

   - Everyone comments on the current state, highlight any challenges or blockers.

   1. Collector Design/ delivery system
      - same design, adjusting slope. - chen
      - no one-direction cuz exceed 30cm
      - add counter weight to arm
   2. Strategy
      - pure speed, (go for centre OR go for one in front)
      - sophisticated ball searching + high success collector
      - opponents (mech -, )
      - opening - go to middle.
   3. Vehicle Design
      1. Mech:
         - have overall placement - distance sensors as per SW
         - waiting on electrical
   4. Drive System
      - differential drive. (castor wheels)
      - wheel placement at the back
   5. Power supply
      - most equipment needs good 5V - exploring taking from battery
      - LDO regulator or capacitors.
   6. sensor strategy
      - mech
      - adjustable model of sensor housing (in-progress) - tim, hong wei
      - have overall placement
      - distance sensors as per SW
      - waiting on electrical
      - electrical:
      - testing distance sensor - to detect the ball.
      - range fluctuates beyond a certain distance => short range is ok.
      - conical (slight slant to right), height of ball sensing wrt to distance.
      - sensors are hit or miss in reliability. (cable may be issue)
      - light/line sensing - testing
      - vex vs arduino on sensing: slight difference.
   7. software strategy
      1. power
      2. sensing
         - moving ball strategy
         - beyond certain threshold, can we detect (true/ false)
         - under a certain threshold, can we return a distance
         - limit the input to the distance function
         - inplace rotate when ball is near
      3. navigation
         - 3 search/ goto ball motions

2. **Review of Timeline**

   - check availability of members.
   - Set responsibilities for the next week
