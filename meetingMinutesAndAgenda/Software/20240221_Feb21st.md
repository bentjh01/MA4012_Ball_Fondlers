# SW Meeting Agenda

## Date: Feb 21st, 2024

## Time: 2030-2130 hrs

## Attendees:

- Benjamin Teh
- ...

## Agenda:

1.  Status Quo
    - checking on status of dev environment
    - responsibilities of the arduino and vex cortex in terms of sensing, planning, actuating.
2.  arduino_ws

    - list responsibilities of the arduino.
    - going through the folder organisation.
    - going through the workflow. i.e. making features, git merge main, making pull requests.
    - how to manage libraries? i.e. everyone has it on their ide or use the source files

3.  robotc_ws

    - list responsibilities of the vex cortex.
    - going through the folder organisation.
    - receives linX and angZ velocities

4.  Main robot tasks:

    - discuss overall architecture
    - RTOS: everyone's functions shoudl return linear and angular velocity

    - go through whole flow of tasks. highlight need for recurring tasks/ break points etc.
    - highlight anything that needs confirmation i.e. identify assumptions about sensors, actuators etc.

    1. Search + Goto ball + opponent detect : Bryan
       - keep ball in front in straight line
    2. collect ball - Eunice
    3. deliver ball - Ben
    4. edge avoidance - Zifu

    - motor control - later
    - sensor reading - Ben

      case 1:
      executed_velicty = search_ball_vel();
      executed_ang = search_ball_angl();
      case 2:
      goto_ball(); align with ball
      if (some_condition){
      task_state = 1
      }
      if (short_distance_sensor < X && !opponent){
      task_state = 3
      }
      case 3:
      collect_ball();
      if (some_condition){
      task_state = 1
      }
      if (ball_inchamber){
      task_state = 4
      }

          case 4:
          	deliver_ball();
          	if (delivered){
          		task_state = 1
          	}

      send(linX)
      send(angZ)
      // this if statement and all computations are to be non-blocking
      \*/
