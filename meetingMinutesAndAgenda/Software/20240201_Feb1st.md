bentjh01 Notes:

- using switch cases instead of if-else (source)[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/switch-vs-else/]
- make thresholds easily configurable, place values in a config file.
- make code easily readable i.e. put files that will likely not be changed away, and try to keep configurable values in a config file.
- robot model
- pid controller
- conversion of encoder values to rpm then further to m/s
- sensor fusion i.e. (kalman filtering)[https://www.kalmanfilter.net/default.aspx]
- filtering i.e.

> Functions:
>
> 1. Search for the Ball
>
> - Detect the ball
> - detect opponents
> - distinguish opponents from the ball
>
> 2.  Go to Ball
>
> - Planning
>   - know position of the ball relative to robot
>     - know global position of robot
>       - localisation
>     - global position of the ball
> - Reactive
>   - find anglular displacement between ball and robot
>   - use controller e.g. PID to keep angular displacement to a minimum
> - avoid opponent while going to ball
> - keep count of number of balls collected
> - avoid opponent
>
> 3.  Collect Ball
>
> - Put ball in carrying chamber
> - verifying that it is in carrying chamber
>
> 4.  Deliver the ball
>
> - orientate delivery system to the delivery point.
> - move to the delivery system without hitting opponent
> - detect trigger to release ball
> - release ball
